## Web Components Usage

### 1. Installation

#### Install the Astro UXDS Classification Markgins package via Command Line (Preferred Method)

The name of the package reflects its earlier history as Astro UXDS Modal.

```sh
npm i --save @astrouxds/rux-classification
```

You may use Yarn, NPM, or your Node package manager of choice. The `--save` flag adds this component as a dependency in your `package.json` file.

#### **Alternatively**, download the [Astro UXDS Component Library](https://github.com/RocketCommunicationsInc/astro-components/src/master/) source to your project.

Via CLI:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/RocketCommunicationsInc/astro-components.git
```

Or, [download the Astro UXDS Components as a .zip](https://github.com/RocketCommunicationsInc/astro-components/archive/master.zip)

### 2. Import the Astro Classification Markings Web Component

This example assumes you're using the NPM package in `node_modules`. Otherwise, import the component using the path to the Astro Components directory in your project.

```javascript
import { RuxClassification } from '@astrouxds/rux-classifications/rux-classification.js';
```
