# ag-Grid for Astro

For more complex tables, we recommend using either the community or enterprise tier of [ag-Grid](https://www.ag-grid.com/). While we cannot provide support for ag-Grid or its many features, we do provide light and dark variants of Astro in a theme file consumable by ag-Grid.

## Guidelines
